Subject: Resignation Letter – Pursuing Higher Studies

Dear Sir,

I am writing to formally resign from my position as Management Trainee at Shyam Steel, effective 5th July 2025.

This decision comes after careful consideration, as I have recently been offered the opportunity to pursue higher studies to further advance my academic and professional goals. While I am excited about this next chapter, it was not an easy decision to make, given the enriching experiences and valuable learning I have gained during my time at Shyam Steel.

Working under your guidance and alongside such a talented team has significantly contributed to my personal and professional development. I am truly grateful for the support, exposure, and opportunities I’ve had here, and I carry forward many positive learnings into my future endeavors.

I will ensure a smooth transition during my notice period and am happy to assist in handing over my responsibilities to the designated team member.

Thank you once again for the support and encouragement throughout my tenure. I hope to stay in touch, and I look forward to crossing paths again in the future.

Warm regards,
Himanshu Pandey
